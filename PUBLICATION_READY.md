## 🌟 Promotion Tips

### On LinkedIn:
```
🚀 Excited to share GrantMate - an AI-powered grant writing assistant we built 
at Hack for Social Impact 2025!

Problem: Nonprofits like Project Homeless Connect spend 1+ week per grant 
application, pulling staff away from serving communities.

Our Solution: RAG-powered system that reduces that time to ~1 hour, using 
Google Gemini, FastAPI, and React.

Key features:
✅ Intelligent sponsor tailoring
✅ Automatic source citations
✅ Truth guardrails (no AI hallucinations)
✅ Honest fit scoring

Built with @Jadelyn Tran for real impact. Check it out! 👇

### On Twitter/X:
```
Just shipped GrantMate at @HackSocialGood! 🚀

Helps nonprofits write grants in 1 hour instead of 1 week.

RAG + Gemini + React = real impact for orgs like @ProjectHomelessConnect

⭐ Star if you believe in tech for good!
